### Overview
This project contains various Python scripts demonstrating different functionalities and concepts. Below is a list of each Python file along with a brief explanation of its content.

### Folders and Descriptions

##### collections
Several samples of how to use collections in Python

##### data_types
This folder demonstrates the use of Python lists containing elements of various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and NoneType. It also includes an example of list comprehension to create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

##### DI (Dependency Injection)
This folder contains a couple of examples that show how to use dependencies injection in Python with decorators.
    - dependency_injection_plus.py shows callback pattern

##### directories
Sample who shows the contents of any directory

##### flow_control
This folder contains Python scripts demonstrating various flow control structures such as conditionals, loops, and pattern matching using the `match`/`case` statement. These examples illustrate how to control the flow of execution in a Python program based on different conditions and patterns.

##### functions
Uses of functions in Python

##### generator
Uses of generators sample 

##### math
Several uses of Math module

#### matplotlib
Several samples of how to use matplotlib. 
NOTE: This samples are taken of official site, see more at https://matplotlib.org/

##### multi-thread
This folder contains couple of examples showing how to use multi-threading and manage exceptions

##### override
How it's working in Python the overriding of methods

##### pandas
A couple of samples using Pandas to manipulate data (ML)

#### polymorphism
Polymorphism in Python


##### samples
* **"Guess the Number"** game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has 8 attempts to guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the secret number and congratulates the user if they guess correctly within the allowed attempts.
* **"Hangman game"**. The program selects a random word from a predefined list, and the user has to guess the word by entering one letter at a time. The program displays the word with underscores for missing letters and reveals the correct letters as the user guesses them. The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
* **numPy**. Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* **Scipy**. Builds on NumPy and provides additional functionality for scientific and technical computing
* **Pandas**. Offers data structures and data analysis tools for handling structured data.
* **matplotlib**. A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **Pillow**. A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that adds image processing capabilities.
* **Scraping**. Demonstrates how to scrape data from a website using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries.

##### shutil_os
Several samples of how to use shutil and os modules 

##### testing
Several examples of how to test Python code using the `unittest` module.

##### zip
Uses of zip function in Python


### How to Run
To run any of the scripts, navigate to the directory containing the file and execute it using Python. For example:
```sh
python data_types/lists_plus.py
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher (for `match_case.py`)
- No additional libraries are required for these scripts.

### Additional Resources
For more advanced examples, the book "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition" by Eric Matthes is highly recommended.
See https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition for more information.
