## README

### Overview
This project contains various Python scripts demonstrating different functionalities and concepts. Below is a list of each Python file along with a brief explanation of its content.

### Folders and Descriptions

##### data_types
This folder demonstrates the use of Python lists containing elements of various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and NoneType. It also includes an example of list comprehension to create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

##### flow_control
This folder contains Python scripts demonstrating various flow control structures such as conditionals, loops, and pattern matching using the `match`/`case` statement. These examples illustrate how to control the flow of execution in a Python program based on different conditions and patterns.

##### samples
This file contains a simple "Guess the Number" game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has 8 attempts to guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the secret number and congratulates the user if they guess correctly within the allowed attempts.

### How to Run
To run any of the scripts, navigate to the directory containing the file and execute it using Python. For example:
```sh
python data_types/lists_plus.py
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher (for `match_case.py`)
- No additional libraries are required for these scripts.

### Additional Resources
For more advanced examples, the book "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition" by Eric Matthes is highly recommended.
